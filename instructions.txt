Moodle Bar V1.0 (Lewis Carr | www.lewiscarr.co.uk)

1) Copy the folder /moodlebar into the root of your chosen theme

2) Add the following code to your footer.html file just before the close body tag </body> or boefre your last </div> tag.
   

<?php include ('moodlebar/moodle_bar.html'); ?>


3)Save the file and away you go.

4)If your Moodle site is not 100% width then there is a line of CSS to change in the file (moodle_bar.html), 
set this to your desired width in pixels.  I've put a comment in the file as to where this is.
